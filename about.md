## Rob Martin

![My Handsome visage](/images/rob_martin.jpg)

So that I don't repeat the details of my [Linkedin Profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/rob-martin/28/721/591), the basics are as follows.

* I'm a father of two wonderful kids, pictures of whom I endlessly <del>spam</del> share with friends and family on Google+.
* I'm married to a very intelligent and sympathetic woman, who will be canonised, eventually.
* I studied Art History long enough to realise that I'd never make a <em>good</em> academic Art Historian.
* I spend <em>way too much</em> money on gadgets, a situation worsened by my recent discovery of [ibuygou.com](http://www.ibuygou.com/) <em>et al</em> the fact that I can name this as commodity fetishism merely compounds things.
* I'm interested in the intersection of technology and culture and on particularly optimistic days get quite giddy with excitement exploring the possible uses of technology to enhance learning & teaching, on other days <strong>grumpy</strong> would be more accurate description.
* I trained as a teacher, taught History, became an ICT Consultant for the local authority, managed a [City Learning Centre](http://www.leeds-clcs.org) and am now an independent educational consultant which is a very long way of saying <em>freelance</em>. 
* I'm a partner in [Beta Filmworks](http://www.betafilmworks.org) which delivers one of the [BFI Film Academies](http://www.bfi.org.uk/education-research/5-19-film-education-scheme-2013-2017/bfi-film-academy-scheme-2013-4)
* I'm rather fond of [Google Apps for Education](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/education/) and am a Google Education Trainer.
