Now obviously I'd like for the [BFI Academy](http://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/project/bfi-film-academy), to win but it would remiss of me not to point out the other fine nominations in the [Education Award](http://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/awards/education) category. 

If you'd like to see some of the work that the Beta Filmworks students from the Leeds City Region have produced check out the <abbr title ="Beta Filmworks">BFW</abbr> on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/BetaFilmworks)
