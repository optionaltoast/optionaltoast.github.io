So I went you for a quick bike ride, just to test out Glass, it was either that or annoy my family all evening by annunciating at regular intervals **"ok glass. Take a photo"** or **"ok glass. Record a video"** so I figured I'd do that in public on a bike, as you do.



## Wyke Beck Way

I trundled off along the <a href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Wyke%20Beck%20Way%20Cycle%20Route.pdf">Wyke Beck Way</a> talking to myself/Glass as I went.  My fears of the Glass slipping off and being crushed under my wheels proved unfounded, they fit rather snuggly under my helmet.  I had some fun taking a few photos, **"ok glass. Take a photo"**

I had some fun sending messages to my wife **"ok glass. Send a message to"** the voice recognition worked pretty well considering my huffing and puffing but you can judge for yourself.

## Action Sequence

No write up about Google Glass would be complete without the <em>obligatory</em> **"ok glass. Record a video"** action sequence, so without further ado I give you, the imaginatively titled.
