Back in November 2013, nursing a broken hand and in a period of *"meaningful work"* with the LA, I decided to treat myself, but this would be no ordinary treat, this would be a **future treat**. I decided to back the <a href="http://www.poweruptoys.com/products/powerup-v3">PowerUp 3.0</a> through it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/393053146/powerup-30-smartphone-controlled-paper-airplane">Kickstarter campaign</a>.  I'd already been very happy with <a href="http://www.thevamp.co.uk/">The Vamp</a> which I'd funded, so I wasn't unfamiliar with the Kickstarter process.

Well it arrived this week, Tuesday to be precise, and as I've been busy with other things this week I've left it until now to open the box. 

Two guesses what I'll be doing tomorrow ? &#9786;
